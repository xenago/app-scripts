# mkv

Notes about working with Matroska Video (MKV) files.

## All-purpose MKV tool

Use `MKVToolNix`.

https://codeberg.org/mbunkus/mkvtoolnix (formerly at https://gitlab.com/mbunkus/mkvtoolnix)

https://mkvtoolnix.download/downloads.html

Install with `winget` on Windows as `MoritzBunkus.MKVToolNix`.

https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/tree/master/manifests/m/MoritzBunkus/MKVToolNix

## Extracting tracks from MKVs

Use `mkvcleaver` (requires MKVToolNix).

## Remuxing MKVs

Rewriting MKV files into new, modified versions without re-encoding the original tracks (remuxing) can be done with MKVToolNix. It can also convert files from other container formats into MKV.

### Appending files vs. adding as additional parts

In MKVToolNix, files can be combined to run one after another, if they are similar enough:

https://codeberg.org/mbunkus/mkvtoolnix/wiki/Adding-files-vs.-Appending-files-vs.-adding-as-additional-parts#appending-files-vs-adding-as-additional-parts

**TL;DR from the official doc:**

* Media files split somewhere in the middle at an arbitrary position so that the second part doesn't have a full set of headers ➡ choose `Add as additional parts`
  * DVDs use this method, for example the `VTS_01_1.VOB`/`VTS_01_2.VOB` files are all logically part of one huge file.
* For most cases, files contain full sets of headers ➡ choose `Append`
  * Blu-ray `.m2ts` files can have different internal stream/track IDs for the same logical video track, so the best option is to add `.mpls` playlist files instead

## Editing MKVs

In-place modification of MKV files with `mkvpropedit` via CLI or with the `jmkvpropedit` GUI (both require MKVToolNix).

### Flags

Flags can be set on tracks to identify if they are SDH/commentary etc.

https://gitlab.com/mbunkus/mkvtoolnix/-/issues/3011

https://github.com/ietf-wg-cellar/matroska-specification/blob/master/ebml_matroska.xml

#### Some useful flags:

* `flag-hearing-impaired=1`
* `flag-commentary=1`

#### Example command to set `FlagHearingImpaired` on the first subtitle track of a file:

`"C:\Program Files\MKVToolNix\mkvpropedit.exe" "X:\file.mkv" --edit track:s1 --set flag-hearing-impaired=1`

#### Equivalent action in `jmkvpropedit` GUI
